"""Draft a sidecar per paper from the paper itself, for a human to verify.

A sidecar is the one per-paper input nothing else in this repo can derive: the claims
in quotable form, the scope conditions each holds under, the terms of art used in a
non-obvious sense, and the misreadings worth pre-empting. It is also what decides
whether an engine describes the work *correctly* rather than merely finds it.

The earlier framing of this file was that only the author could supply that, so 116 of
117 papers had none and the worklist asked for ten minutes each -- nineteen hours of
work that would never be done. That framing was wrong in a specific way: a claim with
its magnitude, a scope condition, and a definition of a coined term are all *in the
paper*. What the author uniquely holds is the judgement about whether a draft got them
right, and which misreading is the one that actually keeps happening.

So this drafts, and the human verifies. That is a different task and a much smaller
one: reading a page of extracted claims and correcting them is minutes, and it starts
from the paper's own numbers rather than from a blank file.

Drafts land in `data/sidecars/drafts/<slug>.md`, never in `data/sidecars/`. Nothing
reads the drafts directory -- the site, the validator, the fidelity check and the
coverage count all glob `data/sidecars/*.md` one level up. An unverified draft
therefore cannot reach a published page by accident, which is the property that makes
drafting safe to do in bulk. Promotion is explicit:

    python scripts/draft_sidecars.py                    # queue drafts for the 20 most cited
    python scripts/draft_sidecars.py --ingest            # fold agent answers into drafts/
    python scripts/draft_sidecars.py --review            # what is drafted, what is live
    python scripts/draft_sidecars.py --accept <slug>     # promote one, after you edited it
    python scripts/draft_sidecars.py --accept-all        # promote every draft

Two modes, matching propose_topics.py:

  llm.mode: skill  (default)  writes build/sidecar_tasks.json for an agent session to
                              fill in. No API key. This is the paper-geo skill's path.
  llm.mode: api               calls the Anthropic API directly, for unattended reruns.
